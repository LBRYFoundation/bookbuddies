# bookbuddies is made by the LBRY Foundation

The LBRY Foundation is a Delaware-based nonprofit dedicated to supporting the LBRY community. bookbuddies was made because content on LBRY often doesn't have many seeds.

All current board members, as well as known active and interested developers, can become maintainers. They review code coming into the project, and are often the first people to provide support.

Anyone can contribute to bookbuddies - it is free and open source software. To get involved, you can join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/lbry) and start making [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md).
