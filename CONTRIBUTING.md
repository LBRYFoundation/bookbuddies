## Getting Started

To get started with contributing to bookbuddies, simply set the repo up as described in the [readme](README.md#setup) and use the `dev:cli` or `dev:gui` commands depending on what you want to do. [Open a pull request](https://github.com/LBRYFoundation/bookbuddies/compare) once you think it's ready to merge.

If you're unfamiliar with the codebase, you can try working on a [good first issue](https://github.com/LBRYFoundation/bookbuddies/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

> [!TIP]
> Contributing to a codebase you haven't seen before can seem challenging at first, but you might find that it's easier than you think!

## Code Style Guidelines

This project uses Prettier for formatting and ESLint for linting. You can check for (and potentially fix) any issues by running `bun lint`.

The project is set up to help you write code at your pace, so it doesn't include any precommit hooks or run `bun lint` when you use dev commands. As well as making sure you run it before you commit, this is an opportunity to make sure you have ESLint checks and Prettier format-on-save in your editor.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on the GitHub repository. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue and any relevant error messages.
