# The LBRY Foundation takes security issues seriously

If you find a vulnerability while looking through bookbuddies, please disclose this immediately to [board@lbry.org](mailto:board@lbry.org?subject=Responsible%20disclosure%20for%20vulnerability%20in%20bookbuddies).

We kindly request that you follow responsible disclosure practices when you report an issue to us. This means:

- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce and any potential impact.
- Allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the issue before disclosing it publicly.
- Do not exploit the vulnerability or share it with others until it has been resolved.

If your vulnerability report leads to a fix, we will credit you for discovering it.

The LBRY Foundation will never pay for a vulnerability disclosure prior to knowing what it is. We may award funds for a security disclosure, depending on severity, on a case-by-case basis.
