# The LBRY Foundation takes security issues seriously

If you find a vulnerability while looking through bookbuddies, please disclose this immediately via the [security tab](https://github.com/LBRYFoundation/bookbuddies/security)

We kindly request that you follow responsible disclosure practices when you report an issue to us. This means:

- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce and any potential impact.
- Allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the issue before disclosing it publicly.
- Do not exploit the vulnerability or share it with others until it has been resolved.

If your vulnerability report leads to a fix, we will credit you for discovering it. You will see the progress on your report within the security tab.

The LBRY Foundation will never pay for a vulnerability disclosure prior to knowing what it is. We may award funds for a security disclosure after fixing it, depending on severity, on a case-by-case basis.
