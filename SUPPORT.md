# Support

> [!TIP]
> Before you go into support channels, see if your question is answered by the [documentation](https://bookbuddies.lbry.org/docs)! Doing this can help save you time.

To get support with this project, you can ask:

- In the [#bookbuddies channel in the Discord server](https://discord.gg/lbry) **(recommended!)**
- Through the [discussions tab](https://github.com/LBRYFoundation/bookbuddies/discussions)
- In the [Telegram group](https://t.me/lbryofficial)
- By emailing [board@lbry.org](mailto:board@lbry.org?subject=Issues%20with%20bookbuddies&body=Hello!%0D%0A%0D%0AI'm%20trying%20to%20use%20the%20%5BCLI%2FGUI%5D%20version%20of%20bookbuddies%2C%20but%20%5Bissue%20here%5D.%0D%0A%0D%0AYou%20can%20reproduce%20this%20issue%20by%3A%0D%0A%0D%0A%5Blist%20the%20steps%20we%20need%20to%20take%20to%20cause%20the%20same%20problem%20you%20found%5D%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20expected%20this%20to%20%5Bsomething%5D%2C%20but%20it%20%5Bsomething%20else%5D%20instead.%0D%0A%0D%0AThanks%2C%0D%0A%5Bname%5D) (not recommended - getting a response can take a long time, and you're less likely to get a good answer)

If you're experiencing an issue with the software, and you know the problem is with bookbuddies and not your setup, you can also [open an issue](https://github.com/LBRYFoundation/bookbuddies/issues) after making sure one doesn't already exist.

Getting support might seem daunting, but we're friendly people! In some cases, it might even help get a bug fixed.
